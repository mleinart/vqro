This repo contains the Vaquero time-series database server and clients.

Vaquero aims to be a highly reliable, performant, and scalable foundation
for storing time series data. It is a work in progress, not currently suitable
for production use. There is no documentation yet (too early), if you're
interested in contributing let me know.
